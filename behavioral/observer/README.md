# Observer
Observer is a pattern in which an object, called **subject**, maintains a list of its dependents, called **observers**, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

Intent:

 - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and update automatically,
 - Encapsulate the core components in a Subject abstraction and the variable components in an Observer hierarchy,
 - The View part of Model-View-Controller.
