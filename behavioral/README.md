# Behavioral design patterns
Behavioral desing patterns identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Patterns:
* [Observer](https://github.com/hradecek/design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/observer) -
a way of notifying change to a number of classes;
* [Strategy](https://github.com/hradecek/design-patterns/tree/master/behavioral/strategy) -
encapsulates an algorithm inside a class.
